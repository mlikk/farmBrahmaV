::FARM BRAHMA::

AI-Powered Recommendations: At its core, the app features a Profitability Forecaster and Personalized Planting Advisor. Using Google's Gemini models, it analyzes hyper-local environmental data, market trends, and a farmer's specific details (like farm size and soil type) to recommend the most profitable crops and provide detailed risk analysis.
Live Data Dashboards: It presents real-time data for Market Trends (crop prices from local mandis), Environmental Conditions (weather, soil moisture, UV index), and a dynamic Dashboard Summary that gives a quick overview of the most critical information.
Interactive Farm Mapping: Farmers can precisely map their farm boundaries using an interactive map, which helps in calculating farm area and provides geospatial context for more accurate AI recommendations.
Community Forum: It features a dedicated community space where farmers can connect, share knowledge, and discuss best practices, powered by Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
Multilingual Interface: The app is fully internationalized to support multiple Indian languages (English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu) to ensure it is accessible to farmers across different regions.
